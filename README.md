### Raspberry Pi Bluetooth Network Deauthentication Tool
Bump every entity off a network, wirelessly without wifi with the use of bluetooth. The idea of this project is intended for the server(Raspberry pi) to be able to be hidden in a backpack or a remote place, and for the attacker to communicate with it via android or laptop, using the client program to send the malicious code to the pi, bumping the entire network.
## Required hardware
* Raspberry Pi model 3
* Monitor Mode Wifi Adapter
  - Alfa AWUS036NH
* Portable Power Supply for Pi
## Required Software
* Python
  - PyBluez library
* Root Privalage
* Bluetooth Capable PI and Client
## Disclaimer
  The only difficult items to get might be the pi and the antenna
  
  
  ### Why I Made this
  I think I decided to create this for a desire to apply some cool security knowledge, and as a way to further understand more how bluetooth communicates with devices and software aswell as how it might be applicable in a cyber attack and cyber deffense situation. I hope you all enjoy the hack! I also wanted to create something to teach people about network communication methods, and help visualize an aspect of hacking people might not have thought was possible.
