  ### Why I Made this
  I wanted to develop something so I could learn to understand Bluetooth communication and wireless/Wifi-less accesibility. I wanted to create something with an interesting concept, and the use of a raspberry pi, to further add to the portablity of this project. Plus being able to bump off an entire network, seems like a pretty powerful thing to be able to use.
  
### Raspberry Pi Bluetooth Network Deauthentication Tool
Bump every entity off a network, wirelessly without wifi with the use of bluetooth. The idea of this project is intended for the server(Raspberry pi) to be able to be hidden in a backpack or a remote place, and for the attacker to communicate with it via android or laptop, using the client program to send the malicious code to the pi, bumping the entire network.
## Required hardware
* Raspberry Pi model 3
* Monitor Mode Wifi Adapter
  - Alfa AWUS036NH
* Portable Power Supply for Pi
## Required Software
* Python
  - PyBluez library
* Root Privalage
* Bluetooth Capable PI and Client
## Disclaimer
  The only difficult items to get might be the pi and the antenna
  Please do not use this on any networks you do not have permission to use. It is illegal and can get you in a lot of trouble. I hold no responsibility for how this project is used. Please be smart!
